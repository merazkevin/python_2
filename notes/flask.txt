flask Flow:
    The HTTP request is made and hits the server.py file.
    Based on the route we give, it gathers up any HTML, CSS, JS, and data.
    Then it responds back to the browser with what we return.
    Eventually we will be breaking down the functionality of 
    the Flask server into separate parts, but for now this is our simple server.

Rendering Data on a Template
    Now how do we use that data on the HTML? There are 2 special inputs we can use 
    to insert Python-like code into our Flask templates.

What is Jinja?
    Jinja is a fast, expressive, extensible templating engine. Special placeholders 
    in the template allow writing code similar to Python syntax. Then the template is passed data to render the final document.
    jinja is an intermeadeater language use to display Html. 

Jinja syntax
    {{ some variable }}
    {% some expression %}
