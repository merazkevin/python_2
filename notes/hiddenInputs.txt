Hidden Inputs
    Hidden input fields are form fields that are hidden from the user. Hidden input
    is used, along with other input elements, to transfer information between
    different pages.
    A hidden input is just an ordinary input element, but has no visual
    representation in the rendered HTML

        <input type="hidden">
        <name="action">
        <value="register">
